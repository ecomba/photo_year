# Photo Year

This is just a little script (as a gem) that will help you keep your year in
photography organised on your file system.

When you want to start a new year in photography (or you are organising old
photos) just run `photo_year <year>` and it will create the whole directory
structure for you.

## Installing

After cloning you'll have to run:

`gem build photo_year.gemspec` _(This will build your gem)_

and right after that

`gem install ./photo_year.gem` or `sudo gem install ./photo_year.gem`
depending if you have a gem manager installed or not on your system.

Once you've done this the command `photo_year` will be available in your
system.

## Usage

Run **photo_year** followed by the year you want to initialise, i.e.
`photo_year 2019` if you want the structure for the year 2019.
